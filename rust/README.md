# Advent of Code - Rust Solutions

This directory contains my solutions for the Advent of Code challenges implemented in Rust.

## How to run

You can run the Rust solutions using `cargo`. Each day's solution is organized in a separate subdirectory.

```bash
$ cargo run 2023 1.0 inputs/2023/01/content.txt
```

Replace `2023` with the year, `1.0` with the day and part (e.g., `1.0` for Day 1 Part 1, `1.1` for Day 1 Part 2), and provide the path to the input file.
